# AI Coding Workflow

## Core Principles

1.  **Follow the Plan:** Adhere strictly to the established plan, design, or documentation discussed previously before implementing code.
2.  **Pre-computation Verification:** Before proposing *any* code modifications (e.g., using the `edit_file` tool):
    *   ALWAYS consult external resources (e.g., using available search or query tools like Perplexity) to confirm the proposed approach is technically sound and aligns with best practices for the relevant libraries/frameworks (React, Konva, TypeScript, etc.). Relying solely on internal knowledge is not sufficient.
    *   Explicitly state the verification step and its outcome (e.g., "I checked with Perplexity about X, and confirmed Y is the recommended approach.").
3.  **Code Correctness:** Ensure the generated code logic correctly implements the intended functionality according to the plan.
4.  **Contextual Fit:** Verify that the proposed changes integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase structure, coding patterns, and style.
5.  **Regression Prevention:** Analyze potential side effects and ensure the changes do not break existing functionality. Where possible, mention how this is being considered.

## Process Integration

*   If verification reveals issues with the planned approach, pause implementation, report the findings, and propose a revised approach before proceeding.
*   Always prioritize correctness, safety, and adherence to the plan over speed.
